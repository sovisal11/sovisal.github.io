                    <p> In 2019, i decided to persue my education in Australia because of the relaxing socail environment after a long year of challenging in Singapore and Cambodia education system. 
                        I guess that right, nothing is easy. University still challenging regardless the system. In 2019, i enrolled into Bachelor degree of Business Information System just to relise that 
                        i prefer computer science more. Therefore, after one semester of Information System, i decided to transfer to computer science school at Swinburne Univeristy of Technology majoring
                        in Data Science. According to my study plan, it is expected to finish the course at the middle of year 2023.
