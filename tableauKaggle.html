this is new page for project i want similae theme will find the way
Idea might not be to create new page but using href to refer to link outside of the website like google drive, tableau or github


Other idea maybe, create another <section> that will assign to each page of Portfolio but did not show in the side tabs using the 
    same nav bar and theme so user and go back and forth without creating new html page so it might be harder to manage user journey


    More idea i want to change is the sidebar in contact could be replace with certification and extra work then contact
    or option 2 might remain contact sidebar, but add more section for certification that i earn from deliote, ibm and google etc...
